### Example

## DMT/animation
Animations are such complex objects (even with the new format), that they deserve their own file, which you can find [here](animations.md).



## DMT/animationOff
Animations are such complex objects (even with the new format), that they deserve their own file, which you can find [here](animations.md).


## DMT/appearance
Changes various aspects of the triggering farmer's appearance. 

### Accepted Value
Changes take a comma-separated pair: {type},{value}. Types can include:

- hairstyle (number value - each hairstyle has an associated number (see `Data/HairData` for vanilla hairstyles)
- haircolor (#FFFFFF color value)
- eyecolor  (#FFFFFF color value)

"DMT/buff_On": "MindMeltMax.WeirdEvents/Gooped,Sludge Tile"



## DMT/changeIndex
Change the index of the tile currently under the player.

### Accepted Values
* An empty string, this will remove the tile from the layer.
* A number representing a different index in the same tilesheet as the current tile.
* A combination of an existing tilesheet id (string) and an index in said tilesheet (number) split by a forward slash ('/').
* A collection of option 2 or 3 to create an animated tile split by a space (' ') followed by comma (',') and the interval between frames in milliseconds

### Examples
* "DMT/changeIndex_On": ""

* "DMT/changeIndex_On": "indoors/57"  
* "DMT/changeIndex_On": "indoors/1741 indoors/1773 indoors/1805 indoors/1773 indoors/1741,250"



## DMT/changeMultipleIndex
Change multiple tile indexes on the current map.

### Accepted Values
Every accepted value for this works the same as [Change Index](#change-index), however they should be prefixed with the layer and tile coordinates.

### Examples
This example mixes some available values from [Change Index](#change-index), you can mix and match the variants from there as you need them here, as long as they are prefixed by '\{layer id\} \{x position of tile\} \{y position of tile\}=...', each one must bu split by a pipe ('|').

"DMT/changeMultipleIndex_Enter": "Buildings 12 27=indoors/472|Buildings 12 28=indoors/473|Buildings 12 29=indoors/474|Buildings 13 27=indoors/504|Buildings 13 28=indoors/505|Buildings 13 29=indoors/506|Buildings 14 27=indoors/536|Buildings 14 28=indoors/537|Buildings 14 29=indoors/538"



## DMT/changeMultipleProperties
Change the properties of multiple tiles.

### Key
"DMT/changeMultipleProperties"

### Accepted Values
A pipe ('|') delimited string of key=value pairs.  
Unlike with [Change Properties](#change-properties), here the key is split up into multiple parts separated by comma's (',').  
These parts are formatted like:
* (optional) The tile layer id to select the tile from
* The tile x position
* The tile y position
* The actual tile property

**Note** if the "=value" is ommited, the property will be removed instead.

### Example
"DMT/changeMultipleProperties_Once_On": "Buildings,17,8,Action=MindMeltMax.YouWishThisExisted/CouponMachine|Buildings,17,8,Passable|17,8,NoFurniture=T"  
"DMT/changeMultipleProperties_Enter": "NoFurniture=T|TouchAction=MindMeltMax.WeirdEvents/BossFight7"



## DMT/changeProperties
Change the properties of a tile.

### Accepted Value
A pipe ('|') delimited string of key=value pairs.

**Note** if the "=value" is ommited, the property will be removed instead.

### Example
"DMT/changeProperties_On": "TouchAction|Action=kitchen"



## DMT/chest
Spawn a chest with item's (and/or money).

### Accepted Value
A string with multiple parts, defined as follows:

* (optional) The non-qualified item id of the chest followed by a pipe ('|').
* A space (' ') delimited string of either items or money as defined in the formats for [give](#give-item) and [take](#take-item).

**Note** that since the 1.6 update, a chest can not directly contain money. The workaround for this is that DMT will add the new Gold coin object with the stack size being the amount of money, each gold coin is worth 250 money.

### Example
"DMT/chest_Once_MonsterSlain": "7 12=BigChest|Money/10 (O)336,5 (O)384,17 (O)125"  
"DMT/chest_Once_On": "15 15=(O)349,3 (O)773,3 (O)772" 



## DMT/emote
Make the player perform an emote.

### Accepted Value
The numerical id of the emote in string form. This can be found by opening ``Tilesheets\\emotes`` and picking the emote you want. The id will be: (4 x The row of the emote) + 4; the + 4 is added because the first row in the texture is skipped.

### Example
"DMT/emote_Talk(Abigail)": "52"



## DMT/event
Start an event.

### Accepted Values
This action accepts a single string with the entire event script to be played.

However this can now also be loaded directly from the asset.  
The format for this is as follows, each part must be split by a pipe ('|'):
* The event script, in case you just want to include the assetName / event id for the event.
* The name of the asset, if loading from this, also include the asset key in this format: "AssetName#AssetKey"
* The event id to add it to the players seen events.

### Example
"DMT/event_Once_Enter": "|MindMeltMax.WeirdEvents#GoopAliens|goopAlienLanding"  
"DMT/event_Once_On": "I need to write an event script here..."



## DMT/explode

**Note** Tiles with this property will be removed when an explosion hits them. The key should simply be "DMT/explode" with no modifiers.

### Example
"DMT/explode": ""  
"DMT/explode": "myTileExplodedMailFlag"  



## DMT/explosion
Triggers an explosion.

### Accepted value
A comma (',') delimited string with multiple options to use when triggering the explosion. These options are as follows in order:

* The tile y position (must set x too) - defaults to this tile
* The radius of the explosion
* Whether to damage the farmer
* A custom amount of damage
* Whether to destroy objects
* The sound of the explosion - defaults to "explosion"

**Note** all values are technically optional, and any one can be ommited by just leaving the value blank (see examples below).

"DMT/explosion_On": ",,5,120,false,true"

However another accepted value starts with a boolean value ("True" or "False") followed by a pipe ('|') and then either a regular dialogue string (if false) or a string with mail formatting (if true).  

**Note** that regular dialogue works also when true, however mail formatting won't be applied when false.

## DMT/monster
Spawn one or more monsters.

### Accepted Values
Each monster to spawn should be a comma-separated list of values. Multiple mosters can be spawned using a pipe ('|'). The list of values will depend on the specific C# constructor being called, but the first three values should be the C# monster class name, the x coordinate, and the y coordinate in that order. Subsequent values should correspond to constructor parameters besides the spawn position. Possible parameters include:

- integer, e.g. for mineLevel
- boolean, e.g. for hardMode
- color, e.g. for GreenSlimes

**Note** To use this key you will need to know the constructor you want to call. There is a list [here](https://github.com/aedenthorn/StardewValleyMods/blob/master/CustomMonsters/doc/ctor.txt).

**Note** Color parameters should be in the format #FFFFFF.

**Note** This action supports the Custom Monsters mod, in which case you should only pass the first three values.

- value to set the key to

### Example
"DMT/modData_Load": "5,6,AlternativeTexture,MyTextureName"  



## DMT/object
Spawn objects or furniture at given tiles.

### Accepted Values
Each object to be spawned should be a comma-separated list of fields. Multiple objects can be spawn using a pipe ('|').

- (optional) integer 0-4 for furniture rotation, only applicable if spawning furniture

### Example

## DMT/move
Move the player in a direction.

### Accepted Value
2 decimal number values in string form split by a comma (','). These numbers represent the direction the player should move in, where **1** is 1 pixel moved.  
The first number is the x position, setting this to negative makes the player move left, while a positive value makes the player move right.  
The second number is the y position, same logic applies here: negative = down, positive = up.

**Note** that the general rule is 64 pixels = 1 tile, so to make the player move one tile right, the first number needs to be 64.

### Example
"DMT/move_On": "256,77"  
"DMT/move_Off": "-122,320"



## DMT/music
